### Support Us

If you like BGRAControls please [support @circular17 with PayPal](https://sourceforge.net/p/lazpaint/donate/?source=navbar).

### Installing

Use the Online Package Manager to get BGRABitmap and BGRAControls.

Notice that you must check only the packages "bgrabitmappack.lpk" and "bgracontrols.lpk" in the Online Package Manager. The other packages are optional and may need third party packages / libraries to work (OpenGL and PascalScript).

### Optional Components

From v4.4 to v9.0.1.6, the components TBCDefaultThemeManager, TBCKeyboard and TBCNumericKeyboard were not registerd by default to allow Linux users to get a seamless installation with the Online Package Manager not installing third party stuff. From v9.0.1.7, as the necessary package is now part of Lazarus, these components are registered.

If you would like to include/exclude them from the package locally, you may turn on/off the "Register unit" in the package options for each file (bcdefaulthememanager.pas, bckeyboard.pas, bcnumerickeyboard.pas) then compile and rebuild Lazarus. On Linux you may need to install libxtst-dev and libgl-dev.
