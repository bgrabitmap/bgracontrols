        Information and help for SuperGauge V2.0+ and the Test Program
    </p>
    <h2>Test Program Overall Operations</h2>
    <p>
        The test progam has access to just about every property for the gauge. In 
        addition pre-set Gauges are in the dropdown under the Displayed gauge that
        can be used to change the look and expose many different settings. 
    </p>
    <p>
        It's initial use was to help test the gauge functionality, but it's useful
        for changing properties live and seeing how it looks live without a recompile.
        Also LOOK at the code, while not pretty it will show how to do most things
        you would need to do to use the gauge. Also some extra code is included to
        turn the Markers into Min, Max and Peak hold indicators using timers. When
        in doubt look at the code!
    </p>
    <p>
        The left side of the form has the Gauge in the upper portion and 
        the Knobs to control the gauge (Both main pointer and Aux pointer) below it.
    </p>
    Under the Gauge is a dropdown that has a bunch of pre-designed gauges to check out. 
    Changing to any other style will reset most all properties of the gauge, so if
    you have settings and you change the style from the drop down, it will reset
    them from the default as dropped on a form Gauge settings.
    <p>
        The 'Round' checkbox if enabled will take all values from the Knobs and
        round them before setting the gauge. Common status of some of the basic settings
        are all displayed next to the knobs.
    </p>
    Buttons in the group box are as follows -
    <ul>
        <li>Toggle Random - Turns on the random value generation for both pointers. If the knob is RED it indicates the pointer is Disabled.
            A shortcut to enable/disble a pointer is to simply Double Click the knob to toggle a pointers ENABLED status
        </li>
        <li>Overload Positive - Sets the Gauge Value to a value greater then the MaxValue to put the gauge into an OVERLOAD condition</li>
        <li>Overload Negative - Sets the Gauge Value to a value less then the MinValue to put the gauge into an OVERLOAD condition</li>
        <li>Min Value - Sets the gauge to the MinValue</li>
        <li>Max Value - Sets the gauge to the MaxValue</li>
        <li>Numbers +/- - These can change the value by a preset amount</li>
        <li>Zero - Resets a few gauge values (Value, AuxValue, Markers, and a few other things</li>
        <li>Round Value - Will take the current Knob values and ROUNDS them</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The Right side of the form has a Tabbed interface, each tab has related settings and
        allows run time changing of most all properties. These tabs have a lot of controls on them,
        but hopefully it's clear what each one does.
    </p>
    Hovering over most controls will show the controls hint and give a short description
    of what it is trying to do. Again, if unsure, look at the code and see what it's doing.
    <br>
    <h2>The Tabs</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Basic</h3>
    <p>
        The 2 group boxes (Size, Position) let you resize and move the gauge at runtime to see changes. Friendly
        reset buttons also can reset to default sizes. The 3rd groupbox 'Basic' has some important settings for the
        Gauge. The ones to look at are Min/Max values and the Auto Scale check box.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Min and Max values for both the Main and Aux set the range span of the pointers. That is if you
        want your gauge Value to respond to a range of 0-100, then set the MinVal to 0, and MaxVal to 100. Same
        for the independant Aux Pointer.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>These Min and Max Values apply to both Main and Aux Pointers (Examples)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        MinVal = 0, MaxVal = 100 - Simple 0 to 100 range (inclusive) as expected
    </p>
    <p>
        MinVal = -5, MaxVal = 5 - The pointer range will be from -5 to 5
    </p>
    <p>
        MinVal = 100, MaxVal = 0 - The pointer will operate backwards on a range of 100 (Pointer Left most) to 0 (Pointer Right Most) 
        This is useful for Backwards working gauges (See Scale Options)
    </p>
    <p>
		Note : The MinValue and MaxValue are also used for the RangeLED and the Markers for scaling. The AuxMinValue and
		AuxMaxValue have no impact on the RangeLED and Markers</p>
    <strong>
    *****************************************************
    <br>
    NOTE : Setting of the gauge MinValue and MaxValue 
    <br>
    are for the RANGE of the gauge and what the Pointers
    <br> 
    will represent on a 0-270 degree gauge. The settings
    <br>
    of the Scale and how it reads is INDEPENDENT of the
    <br> 
    settings on the Min/Max Value
    <br>
    *****************************************************
    <br>
    </strong>
    <h4>Auto Scale</h4>
    <p>When the Auto Scale checkbox is NOT enabled the gauge will draw with dimensions that are specified
        in the properties. A pixel is a pixel so to speak, no internal scaling done. However IF you design across different platforms
        and either design or deployment is on a HighDPI and one is a Low/NormalDPI monitor you will have a problem in that 
        the size of the component will be changed by the LCL
    </p>
    <p>
        To eliminate this issue set the AutoScale property to true (Click the checkbox in the test program)
    </p>
    <p> To see some effects of the Auto Scale in action, hit the '<strong>+ W&amp;H Size</strong>' button to increase the size of the gauge.
        While the Frame of the gauge will scale in size (with or without Auto Scale), nothing else will. If you do the same with the Auto Scale
        enabled, it will preserve the look of and scale all components of the gauge. This is sometimes needed
        as the LCL will change the scale and thus the size of your component. This is not always desired, so
        the Auto Scale option exists. 
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Frame</h3>
    <p>
        This page contains the basic settings for the 3 Frame rings of the gauge. Colors and Thickness of each can be specified
        for your desired look. 
        <br>
        Changing the thickness of the Outermost will automatically push in the Middle, and Inner as the are drawn with respect to 
        eachother. 
        <br>
        If you do not want to use a particular one set the thickness to zero, or you can also set the color to 
        <strong>clNone</strong> and the ring will be drawn, but transparent. This can be useful for spacing out
        the gauge from other components and such.
    </p>
    <p>Again NOTE that the Frame is the only part that will automatically scale with the size of the Gauge, changing the
        size of the frame rings will NOT change anything else that is displayed (Scale, Pointers, etc).
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Face</h3>
    <p>
        The Face page has a few settings, most are self explanitory. The Fill style allows the background of the face to be
        a few different styles. Try each from the drop down to save me the work of explaining them all.
    </p>
    <p>For the Light Intensity and Curve Exponent they are related to the Phong type of style. Similar to a few other places 
        within the gauge. These change how the shading looks. Just play around for your look. These ONLY affect the look when the style 
        is set to fsPhong Fill Style
    </p>
    <p>The last property of interest is the Picture. You can load an image that can be drawn on the face and moved around.
        This is useful for Logo's or other indicators you may want
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Scales</h3>
    <p>The Gauge has the ability to display 2 different scales. The Main and Aux scale. These both have the same setting options.
        A lot of options exist for the Scales. The topmost options are check boxes that enable specific modes, how tick marks are drawn,
        drawing the scale reversed (from High to low), etc.
    </p>
    <p>Below those options are <strong>Scale Start</strong> and <strong>Scale Step</strong> these along with the
        <strong>Main Tick Count</strong> and <strong>Subtick Count</strong> Determine most of the scale range. 
    </p>
    <strong>Explination Of Each</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Scale Start - The starting value of the scale</li>
        <li>Scale Step - The increment for each Main Tick</li>
        <li>Main Tick Count - The number of Main Ticks</li>
        <li>SubTick Count - The number of ticks between each Main Tick</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Use the Preset Gauge selections on the test program to see specific example and how to set these up.
    <p>
        In addition settings for an arc above or below the Tick marks can be enabled along with a few settings for Fonts and
        related size and color.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>REMEMBER : The settings for the scale have no impact on the Pointers, RangeLED, etc., it's for display ONLY</strong>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Pointers</h3>
    <p>
        Pointers are mapped to the MinValue and MaxValue of the gauge and use those to properly scale pointer movement. The pointers do
        not follow the scale if that is not clear. Their are two pointers, the Main and the Aux. The main pointer follows the gauges Value 
        and the Aux Pointer follows the AuxValue. Pretty simple.
    </p>
    <p>
        The RangeLED follows the Main Pointers Value only. Also both Pointers have 
        the ability to trigger events based on Overload conditions. Anything that is above or below the MinValue or MaxValue 
        (AuxMinValue, AuxMaxValue) can trigger specific events to alert. On overload conditions, the gauge will be 'pegged'
        to the MinValue or MaxValue, and for the Aux pointer similar but will be the AuxMinValue and AuxMaxValue. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The test program will flash some elements RED in these conditions. Also note that the RangeLED can be set to automatically 
        watch for the gauge out of range condition and light up the LED if desired (use the <strong>rcGaugeOutOfRange</strong> setting in RangeLED.RangeType)
    </p>
    Several types of pointers are available.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Pointer Styles</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>psLine - A pointer that eminates from the center of the the gauge outwards</li>
        <li>psLineExt - A pointer with a 'Tail' from the back side of the center and outwards</li>
        <li>psArc - Instead of a pointer from the center of the gauge, this will draw an ARC indicating the position*</li>
        <li>psTriangle - a Triangle shaled pointer*</li>
    </ul>
    * Some settings will not apply to the selected style
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Pointer Notes</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>PointerCap settings are used to draw the pointer cap over or under the pointer, or not at all.</li>
        <li>When the Aux Pointer is drawn it is <strong>ALWAYS</strong> drawn under the main pointer and the cap</li>
        <li>Highlight settings will draw a <strong>CENTER</strong> line for line type pointers and an <strong>OUTLINE</strong> for Triangle pointers, and is ignored for arc.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3>Cap</h3>
    <p>
        The PointerCapSettings is used to set the look of the center cap on the gauge. This is used to get a specific look along
        with the PointerSettings. Position and Style are the main settings along with color and shading.
    </p>
    <strong>Position Settings</Strong>
    <ul>
        <li>cpOver - Draw the cap OVER the pointer</li>
        <li>cpUnder - Draw the cap UNDER the pointer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        NOTE: The AuxPointer is <strong>ALWAYS</strong> drawn under both the Main Pointer and the Cap
    </p>
    <strong>Style Settings</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>csNone - Don't draw the Cap</li>
        <li>csFlat - Draw a solid color (non-shaded) Cap</li>
        <li>csShaded - Draw a simple shaded Cap, uses Edge and Fill Colors to shade</li>
        <li>csPhong - Draw a Phong shaded Cap, uses Light Intensity and Curve as well as Edge and Fill Colors</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
		The reset of the settings are related to the colors and various sizes
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Text</h3>
    <p>
		The Gauge supports three Text objects, each can be customized independently. The offset is based on the center 
		of the Gauge, so OffsetX=0, OffsetY=0 would be the center. These values can be negative or positive to move the 
		text as needed.
	</p>
	<p>
		The reset of the Text Settings are for Font Attributes and are pretty self explanitory.
	</p>
	<p>
		Text can be used for static information or could be used for displaing dyamic information. They are relatively lightweight to
		draw. An example would be to 'digitally' display the gauge value. 
	</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Band</h3>
    <p>
		Bands are a colored Arc to help mark a range on the Scale of the gauge. Their are a total of 4 bands. The bands 
		are based on 0-100% of the gauge, and independent of any MinValue/MaxValue setting. 
    </p>
    <p>
		Bands can have any color, a specific radius and thickness as well as text centered in the arcs range. The position of the
		text from the center of the Gauge will allow different text sizes to be centered in the band, or even out of the band
		Above or Below if desired.
    </p>
    <p>
		As bands are all independent of eachother they can be drawn touching, with a gap, and at various radius to
		allow better usability. An example might be a tachometer where the 'Redline' of the engine is at 6000 RPM. A RED
		band starting at 60 and Ending at 80 in that range would be a common metaphore in automotive gauges. See predefined
		gauges in the test program for examples of Bands.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>RangeLED</h3>
    <p>
		The RangeLED is used for an on Gauge display of a specific condition based on the Value of the gauge. This can be used as an indicator
		for a variety of conditons including over, under and between values. The LED indicator can be moved to any position and has a 
		few different styles and shading options. You can set a Start Value, Ending Value depening on the Range Type selected. One special
		case of the Range Type is to automatically track the Overload condition and toggle the LED based on the MinValue/MaxValues.
    </p>
    <strong>Select Range Error Type</strong>
    <ul>
		<li>rcNone - Not Used, Manual control (Enable/Disable) of the LED is possible</li>
		<li>rcGaugeOutOfRange - Ignores Start and End, uses the Gauge Main Vaues for MinValue/MaxValue Range and will indicate Overload Condition</li>
		<li>rcBetween - Between Start and End, non-inclusive</li>
		<li>rcBothInclusive - Start and End inclusive</li>
		<li>rcStartInclusive - Including Start, up to and not including End</li>
		<li>rcEndInclusive - Between Start, Not Including it, and Including End</li>
		<li>rcBothBetweenOutside - Outside of Start and End, not including them</li>
		<li>rcBothInclusiveOutside - Outside of Start and End, Including them</li>
		<li>rcGreaterStart - Ignore End Value, anything greater then the start</li>
		<li>rcLessEnd - Less than the End value, ignores start</li>
		<li>rcGreaterStartInclusive - Ignores End Value, but includes the Start</li>
		<li>rcLessEndInclusive - Ignores the Start Value, but includes the End</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Note : If the gauge Value is in an Over Range condition the Gauge value will still be checked. Don't
		expect the RangeLED start values to be limited to the MinValue and MaxValue and set the RangeLED Start and End
		values accordingly. This applies only to the Main values not the Aux.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also trying to change the LED state to Active or Not Active may not
		work as the gauge will override the setting if the Range Type is set
		to something other than <strong>rcNone</strong>, which allows for manual control of the RangeLED.
	</p>
	<p>
		The RangeLED can fire a couple of events, RangeLEDActive, and RangeLEDInactive to monitor the state if needed. 
		See example code for how these work. It's pretty simple</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Markers</h3>
    <p>
		Markers are a small triangle that can be used to indicate various things. The Gauge supports three Markers, all 
		with independent settings. The value of the Marker are mapped to
		MinValue and MaxValue of the gauge so it's easily coordinated with the pointer. The shape of the Marker can be a 
		centered triangle, one aligned for below the pointer, and one for above the pointer. The radius, size, and color
		are all adjustable. The set value is with respect to the MinValue and MaxValue of the gauge to allow easy
		coordination of such things as peak values, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Note : The gauge has no mechanism for tracking min, max and peak values as shown in the Test program. This
    	is all done externally to the gauge. See sample code in the Test program to see how it works.
    </p>
