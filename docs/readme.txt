As many people know, Lazarus GTK doesn't have full alpha support. I created a set of components which use TBGRABitmap for drawing icons, so it partially solves the problem with alpha in GTK. But this components set is not only a GTK patch but has more fancy components which are using the power of the BGRABitmap package.
